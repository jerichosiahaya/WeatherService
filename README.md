☁ This is just a sample web api made with .NET 5 Framework. I added an Identity Authentication using ASP JwtBearer Auth package. You can get the access token using [Authentication service](https://github.com/jerichosiahaya/AuthService). I recommended you to use the [API Gateway](https://github.com/jerichosiahaya/OcelotAPIGateway) as the middleman between both services.

This service include [versioning](https://github.com/jerichosiahaya/WeatherService/blob/5fb4017a644fb5fc8a980001acfb99d2e4933dab/WeatherService/Controllers/WeatherForecastController.cs#L13) ✔
